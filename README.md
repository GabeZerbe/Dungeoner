# Dungeoner
- CSC-235 PyGame Project
- Final project for Computer Science 235: Game Design
- Prof: Dr. Andrew Thall
- Created by Gabe Zerbe

The goal of this final project was demonstrate the ability to: 
- generate a game map using a tiling system with multiple stages
-  implement a scoring system that will track the players score between stages
-  implement character and object sprite animation using the PyGame libraries
-  basic collision physics with the stage and the objects within it. 


# How to Play

Once in game, use the Arrow Keys or WASD Keys to controller your dungeoner. Collect ancient coins scattered around the dungeon before advancing to the next floor and eventualy finding your way out!
