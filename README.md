Prof: Dr. Andrew Thall

Created by Gabe Zerbe

The goal of this final project was demonstrate the ability to: generate a game map using a tiling system with multiple stages, implement a scoring system that will track the players score between stages, implement character and object sprite animation using the PyGame libraries, basic collision physics with the stage and the objects within it.
